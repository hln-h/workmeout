## Project status

If you have run out of energy or time for your project, put a note at the top of the README saying that development has slowed down or stopped completely. Someone may choose to fork your project or volunteer to step in as a maintainer or owner, allowing your project to keep going. You can also make an explicit request for maintainers.

_This is a student project that was created at [CodeOp](http://codeop.tech), a full stack development bootcamp in Barcelona._
